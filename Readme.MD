## Data-Mining 
## Spring 2022 USC DSCI553 (Foundations and Applications of Data Mining)
### @Recruiters and Hiring Managers, please contact for access

#### Description
Data mining is a fundamental skill for massive data analysis. At a high level, it allows the analyst to discover patterns in data, and transform it into a usable product. In this course, data mining algorithms are covered for analyzing very large data sets. This course has an applied focus, in that it is meant for preparing students to utilize topics in data mining to solve real world problems. This particular repository includes the programming assignments which were mainly done using __pyspark__ which is a distributed computing framework making extensive use of the __RDD (resilient distributed dataset) API__.
